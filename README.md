# Concurrency Playground

**Concurrency Playground** is a project where I explored and experimented with some of the Swift Concurrency concepts.

---

## Topics Explored

- **Preconcurrency Protocol Conformance**: Testing the use of the `@preconcurrency` attribute for legacy protocol conformance in isolated types. 
- **Unstructured Task Cancellation**
- **Global Actor Inheritance in Classes**: Understanding how classes inherit isolation from their superclasses in asynchronous and synchronous functions.
- **Actor Inheritance in Closures**: Exploring how an actorâ€™s context is inherited when closures are defined within it.
- **Functions with `isolated any Actor` Parameters**: Understading how to use `isolated (any Actor)` function parameter.

**Run and Experiment:**
Modify the examples or add your own experiments to deepen your understanding.

Happy learning and experimenting! ðŸš€
